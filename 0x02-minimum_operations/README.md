# Project Overview

## Goal
Implement a method to calculate the minimum number of operations required to generate exactly `n` characters 'H'.

## Requirements

- **Editors Allowed**: vi, vim, emacs
- **Environment**: Ubuntu 20.04 LTS with Python 3.4.3
- **File Requirements**:
  - End with a new line
  - First line: `#!/usr/bin/python3`
  - Documented code
  - PEP 8 style (version 1.7.x)
  - Executable files

## Concepts and Resources

To solve this problem efficiently, we can use the concept of prime factorization.

- **Dynamic Programming**: Break down the problem into simpler subproblems.
- **Prime Factorization**: Reduce the problem by finding the sum of the prime factors of `n`.
- **Code Optimization**: Optimize the code for efficiency.
- **Greedy Algorithms**: Use greedy algorithms to choose the best option at each step.
- **Basic Python Programming**: Ensure proficiency in Python, including loops, conditionals, and functions.

## Task 0: Minimum Operations (mandatory)

Write a method to calculate the minimum number of operations to achieve exactly `n` characters 'H' in the file.
