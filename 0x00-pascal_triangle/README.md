# Project Title: Pascal's Triangle

## Description:
This project involves implementing Pascal's Triangle in Python. Pascal's Triangle is a mathematical construct that consists of a triangular array of binomial coefficients. Each number in the triangle is the sum of the two directly above it. The project aims to develop a Python function that generates Pascal's Triangle up to a specified number of rows.

## Algorithm:
The algorithm for generating Pascal's Triangle involves creating a list of lists of integers. Each inner list represents a row of the triangle, and the integers within each row are the binomial coefficients. The algorithm utilizes concepts such as lists, list comprehensions, functions, loops, conditional statements, recursion (optional), arithmetic operations, indexing and slicing, memory management, error and exception handling (optional), efficiency, and optimization.
